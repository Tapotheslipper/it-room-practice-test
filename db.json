My mistake was using the evidence presented and applying my real-world bias towards politicians so it seemed like a no-brainer. Sorry bro. I did decide everyone should get passage though and felt it it was only right that he get the first ride. Had no idea where to take him so I sailed to the Pillars of the Dead and placed him there.",

A lot of people hate it because “It StEpS OuT Of ThE AC LoRe”… (yes, I’ve read that multiple times from multiple people as if they were programmed robots copying one another) and basically refuse to accept that the game is great and one of the best. Every play through I have done, I can’t really find anything bad to say about this game. I like Shadows but if you line it up with the other recent titles like Origins, Valhalla & Mirage… Odyssey still beats them in my opinion. ",
